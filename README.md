## Overview

UDX is a QUIC-inspired, UDP-based transport protocol that provides reliable, ordered delivery with advanced networking features. This Dart implementation offers the core building blocks for creating high-performance, connection-oriented communication over UDP.

## Key Features

- **Reliable & Ordered Delivery** - TCP-like reliability over UDP
- **CUBIC Congestion Control** - Optimal throughput with adaptive bandwidth utilization  
- **Multi-layer Flow Control** - Both connection and stream-level flow control
- **Connection Migration** - Seamless network path changes for mobile applications
- **Path MTU Discovery** - Automatic optimization of packet sizes
- **Packet Pacing** - Smooth network utilization to prevent bursts
- **Stream Multiplexing** - Multiple concurrent streams per connection
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Responsive, asynchronous I/O

## Installation

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_udx: ^0.3.0
```

Then run:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Server

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:dart_udx/udx.dart';

void main() async {
  final udx = UDX();
  final socket = await RawDatagramSocket.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  final multiplexer = UDXMultiplexer(socket);

  print('UDX server listening on port 8080');

  multiplexer.connections.listen((connection) {
    print('New connection from ${connection.remoteAddress}');
    
    connection.on('stream').listen((event) {
      final stream = event.data as UDXStream;
      
      stream.data.listen((data) {
        print('Received: ${String.fromCharCodes(data)}');
        stream.add(data); // Echo back
      });
    });
  });
}
```

### Basic Client

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:dart_udx/udx.dart';

void main() async {
  final udx = UDX();
  final socket = await RawDatagramSocket.bind(InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 0);
  final multiplexer = UDXMultiplexer(socket);
  
  final connection = multiplexer.createSocket(udx, '127.0.0.1', 8080);
  await connection.handshakeComplete;

  final stream = await UDXStream.createOutgoing(
    udx, connection, 1, 2, '127.0.0.1', 8080
  );

  // Send data
  final message = 'Hello, UDX!';
  await stream.add(Uint8List.fromList(message.codeUnits));

  // Receive echo
  stream.data.listen((data) {
    print('Received: ${String.fromCharCodes(data)}');
    stream.close();
    connection.close();
  });
}
```

## Architecture

UDX follows a layered architecture for maximum flexibility:

- **`UDXMultiplexer`** - Manages I/O for multiple connections over a single UDP socket
- **`UDPSocket`** - Represents a single logical connection with handshake and flow control  
- **`UDXStream`** - Provides reliable, ordered data streams with congestion control

This design enables advanced features like connection migration, where connections can seamlessly move between network interfaces.

## Advanced Features

- **Connection Migration** - Move connections between network interfaces without dropping
- **Flow Control** - Prevent overwhelming receivers at both connection and stream levels
- **Congestion Control** - CUBIC algorithm with slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery
- **Error Recovery** - Automatic retransmission and duplicate detection
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in RTT, throughput, and congestion window metrics

## Documentation

For detailed API documentation, advanced usage examples, and best practices, see the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

## Performance

UDX is designed for high-performance applications:

- Zero-copy packet processing where possible
- Efficient memory management with configurable buffers
- Packet pacing to maximize network utilization
- Adaptive MTU discovery for optimal packet sizes
